This repository contains a classification problem focused on predicting whether a loan will be approved or not. The dataset used comprises 615 rows and 13 columns, with each row representing a loan application and the columns containing various attributes related to the applicant and the loan itself.

### Dataset Description

- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for each loan application.
- **Gender**: Gender of the applicant (Male/Female).
- **Married**: Marital status of the applicant (Yes/No).
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents on the applicant.
- **Education**: Education level of the applicant (Graduate/Under Graduate).
- **Self_Employed**: Whether the applicant is self-employed or not (Yes/No).
- **ApplicantIncome**: Income of the primary applicant.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Income of the co-applicant (if any).
- **LoanAmount**: Amount of the loan requested (in thousands).
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of the loan in months.
- **Credit_History**: Whether the applicant's credit history meets the required guidelines.
- **Property_Area**: Area where the property associated with the loan is located (Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural).
- **Loan_Status**: Whether the loan was approved or not (Yes/No).

### Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on the provided features. By analyzing historical data and applying various classification algorithms, we aim to create a robust predictive model that lending institutions can utilize to automate and streamline their loan approval process.
